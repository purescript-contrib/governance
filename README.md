# PureScript Contributors Governance

The Contributors organization maintains useful libraries and tools on behalf of the PureScript community. This repository contains helpful resources for writing and maintainging libraries within the Contributors organization.

If you are a PureScript organization or user we encourage you to use any of these resources as you see fit! There is no need to attribute anything to the Contributors organization.

You may want to begin with these resources:

- The [contributing](./contributing.md) guide helps new contributors get started with their first contributions to a member library.
- The [library guidelines](./library-guidelines.md) guide outlines expectations for each library in the organization, including minimum requirements for maintenance, repository structure, documentation, and testing.
- The [contrib-updater](./updater) CLI tool helps maintainers with tasks like standardizing repositories, setting issue labels, migrating new libraries into the organization, and more. It also includes templates for common files like READMEs, continuous integration, and more. 
- The [Pursuit publishing instructions](./pursuit-preregistry.md).

## What is the PureScript Contributors organization?

The Contributors organization was started by PureScript core members, industrial Purescript users, and individuals to create and maintain commonly-used libraries for the PureScript ecosystem. It can be seen as an extension of the official PureScript organization which is less selective about membership and which is open to a broader set of libraries.

The Contributors organization is also a great way for newcomers to PureScript to get their start contributing to open source in PureScript. One of our goals is to encourage new members of the community to feel welcome contributing to the ecosystem.

## How can I join?

Members of the Contributors organization maintain at least one library within `purescript-contrib`. You certainly don't need to be the _only_ maintainer for a library! If you have displayed sustained interest in one or more libraries, feel free to reach out to an existing maintainer of the library or libraries in question to ask if you can become a member.

For more information about joining the organization, please see the [contributing guide](./contributing.md).
